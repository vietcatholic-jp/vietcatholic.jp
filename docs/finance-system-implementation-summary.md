## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema & Migrations

- Created proper indexes for performance

### 2. Type System Updates

  - `app/api/cashier/cancel-requests/[id]/process/route.ts`
- Event-scoped payment confirmation and rejection
- Cancel request processing (approved → processed)
- Proper role validation and logging

### 5. Cashier Dashboard UI

  - `app/api/donations/route.ts`
  - `app/api/donations/public/route.ts`
  - `app/api/admin/donations/[id]/route.ts`
- **UI Files**:
  - `app/donations/public/page.tsx`
  - `app/(protected)/finance/donations/page.tsx` (placeholder)

- Added informational messages for cashier-handled tasks

### 9. Storage & File Management
- **File**: `docs/storage-setup-finance.md`
- Complete storage bucket setup guide
- RLS policies for secure file access
- Event-scoped directory structure
- Role-based file permissions

### 10. Event Scoping
- **File**: `docs/event-scoping-implementation.md`
- All finance operations scoped to events
- Database changes with backfill scripts
- API endpoint event validation
- Frontend event context (documented)

## 🔄 Status Workflow Implementation

### Payment Status Flow
- `pending` → `report_paid` → `confirm_paid`/`payment_rejected` (cashier only)

### Cancel Request Flow  
- `pending` → `approved`/`rejected` (admin) → `processed` (cashier only)

### Expense Request Flow
- `submitted` → `approved`/`rejected` (event holder/admin) → `transferred` (cashier) → `closed` (admin)

### Donation Flow
- `pledged` → `received` (admin)

## 🔐 Security Implementation

- **Role-Based Access**: All endpoints validate user roles
- **Event Scoping**: All operations filtered by event access
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for all tables
- **Private Storage**: File access via signed URLs only
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all API endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: Console logs for all financial operations
